# print vs. return 
"print" only display the result on the screen for humans to see and can not be reused in the next program. "return" gives the result back to the caller, so it can be stored and reused later on in the program.
# bugs and issue
No (after modification)
# resolved issue 
For the first, I type "pirnt" instead of "return" when I define a new function causing a "None" return value. So I reached out to Chatgpt and figured out the difference between "return" and "print". After modifying, the problem was resoved.
